This github repository serves as a database where our team will keep all our source codes here for easy reference.
They will be splitted into three folders, one named DataParsing , one named MachineLearning, and one named as Visualisation.
Inside the folders you will be able to find the source code related to each of the folder's role and there will be a readme
in every folder which will explain about the codes functionality.

There will be a requirements.txt in each of our folders, which indicates the system and downloads required when creating and
using a python environment, as we are using that while running our codes on the machine learning server.
